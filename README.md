# Brewfiles

Welcome to the Brewfiles Repository! This is a community-driven project where users can share their `Brewfile` configurations. By contributing to this repository, you can help others quickly set up their macOS or Linux environments with Homebrew.

## What is a Brewfile?

A `Brewfile` is a convenient way to describe the setup of your Homebrew packages, casks, and taps. It allows you to install all your dependencies with a single command. This is particularly useful for setting up a new machine or sharing your development environment with others.

## How to Use a Brewfile

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/dansholds/brewfiles.git
   cd brewfiles
   ```

2. **Choose a Brewfile**:
   Browse through the available `Brewfile`s in the repository and select one that suits your needs.

3. **Install Packages**:
   Use the `brew bundle` command to install the packages listed in the selected `Brewfile`:
   ```sh
   brew bundle --file=path/to/Brewfile
   ```
